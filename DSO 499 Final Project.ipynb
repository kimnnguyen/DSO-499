    "### Team Members:\n",
    "1. Joao Ama - wrote demand, customer_location, stock_creator functions and helped with the weeksimulator and main loop logic\n",
    "2. Kim Nguyen - wrote profit function, helped with weeksimulator and main, editing/cleaning code\n",
    "3. Teeny Chen - wrote the distance function using functions written by other members and implemented it into the weeksimulator and main functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Structure:\n",
    "Part 1: defining variables and importing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Defined functions relating to customer\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: Defined functions to calculate profit\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4: Defined function to simulate weekly profit using functions above\n",
